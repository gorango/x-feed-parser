The API automatically converted to the correct AppConversionType. For example, if the value DOWNLOAD was passed into v201509 for an iTunes AppConversion, then that value would automatically be converted to FIRST_OPEN.\n\nWhat is the new behavior?\n\nIn v201509, AppConversionType DOWNLOAD changed to FIRST_OPEN for iTunes apps. Here’s what you will need to do:\nFor v201506 or earlier, you must pass in AppConversionType DOWNLOAD rather than FIRST_OPEN.For v201509 or later, you must pass in FIRST_OPEN instead of DOWNLOAD.\nPassing in the incorrect value will result in the error DOMAIN_EXCEPTION from the API starting on November 9.\n\nNote: This only impacts iTunes conversions. There will be no changes to the validation for AppConversions with an AppPlatform of ANDROID.\n\nWhere can I learn more?\n\nFor more information on mobile apps and conversions, check out these guides:\nConversion TrackingMobile App Install CampaignsIncreasing Mobile App Engagement\nQuestions?
